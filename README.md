# Down East Flooding Map Capture Tool

> This project is a Leaflet.js-based mapping tool for managing geocoded locations with enhanced functionality. Features include geocoding within map bounds, detailed search results, a reset control, modal-based labeling with options, and a sortable table displaying circle properties. Built with Bootstrap for styling and SortableJS for draggable rows, it supports editing and deleting circle entries directly from the table. (ChatGPT)
